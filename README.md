# Lab Name
Fabric Multi Channel Network Samples

# Short Description
This lab provides samples for multi channel network using Hyperledger Fabric.

After the [tutorial](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_network.html), a Fabric beginner may want to find out multi channel network samples, and these are the samples.
